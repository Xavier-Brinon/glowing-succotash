** Layout
Pages layout is has been, going for the app layout.
Creating:
- app/layout.js
- app/page.js

Not sure why this is not TS files, but we'll see later.
The ~children~ props in ~layout~ will be the ~page~.

*** Note 📄
~layout.js~ and ~page.js~ need to be exported as ~default~  functions.
Or else it bugs 🐛
#+name: default export of page and layout
#+begin_src javascript
  export default function Page() {};
  export default function RootLayout() {};
#+end_src

** Run
To run the project as is, use the *package.json* script:
~node --run dev~ and it will run a server in [[http://localhost:3000][localhost:3000]]

It would be great to be able to run this with a local certificate.
